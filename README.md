- 👋 Hi, I’m Piyush Jeena, Phd in Theoretical and Computational Physics.
- 👀 Interested in Data science, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
- 📫 Reach me at : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyush-jeena-19664123a/)
- Check few of my projects below.

I have completed my PhD from CNRS and University of Bordeaux. I primarly worked in the area of frustrated magnetism, looking for exotic phases in real materials. I developed numerical methods such as Monte Carlo to generate phase diagrams for many-body systems. I thoroughly enjoy programming and math and have been exploring the field of data science, machine learning and Natural Language Processing(NLP). I enjoy solving problems in novel ways with state-of-the-art methods.
